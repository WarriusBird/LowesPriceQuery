# LowesPriceQuery
A small python script for price checking Lowe's items. 

Reads in a CSV of product SKUs and takes input for the desired store number before returning the price for a given SKU. 

REQUIREMENTS
* Python 3.6
* A list.txt file has to be located in the same location as the script's working directory.

KNOWN ISSUES
* Currently unable to retrieve prices for SKUs where searching on the SKU returns multiple items.
